[![Actions Status](https://github.com/pveyes/raw.macro/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pveyes/raw.macro/actions) [![Babel Macro](https://img.shields.io/badge/babel--macro-%F0%9F%8E%A3-f5da55.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros)

> Webpack [`raw-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/raw-loader) implemented as [`babel-plugin-macros`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros) and [SWC](https://swc.rs/) plugins

## Installation

In order to use raw.macro in your own project, you can use one of the following commands:

```
$ yarn add --dev raw.macro
# or
$ npm install --save-dev raw.macro
```

Make sure `babel-plugin-macros` already installed. If you're using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), it's installed by default.

Alternatively you can use [SWC plugins](#swc) and skip installing `babel-plugins-macros` entirely.

## Usage

raw.macro is similar to Nodeâ€™s `require` call:

```js
import raw from "raw.macro";

const markdown = raw("./README.md");
```

**Note: Because raw.macro uses babel internally to replace `raw()` calls, your transpiled code won't be changed if you only change the file that you import. This is because from babel perspective, your JS file is unchanged**

One workaround that you can do that doesn't involve restarting your build system is making small changes where you put `raw()` calls, for example by adding `console.log()` with different content.

### Custom Encoding

If you want to use custom encoding (by default it will use `utf-8`), you can pass it to the second argument

```js
import raw from "raw.macro";

const binary = raw("./path/to/binary", "binary");
```

### Dynamic path import

You can also use import dynamic path using [template literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals). You can even use them inside a function / React component!

```js
import raw from "raw.macro";

function Article(props) {
  const content = raw(`../content/${props.locale}.md`);
  return <Markdown content={content} />;
}
```

**This method has 2 caveats:**

1. You can only use up to two variables inside template literal. 1 for directory name, and 1 for file name.
2. Using dynamic path import will includes all files that matches your dynamic path, which can make your JS bundle a lot bigger. This is also partly the reason of limitation described in #1

## SWC

You can also use `raw.macro` in a swc-based project (e.g: Next.js) by using the SWC plugins.

Due to how the plugins is loaded, you have to pass `rootDir` option pointing to the root directory of your project (where your `node_modules` directory lives). Typically it's enough to pass `__dirname`.

```js
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    swcPlugins: [
      [
        "raw.macro/swc",
        {
          rootDir: __dirname
        }
      ],
  },
};
```

Note that currently SWC plugins only support reading text file from relative path and node_modules content. Using custom encoding or dynamic path import is not supported.
